# gmk-snips-run

This little plugin enables running [gmk-snippets](https://github.com/YAL-GameMaker/gmk-snippets)
projects (open a `.gmk-snips` in GMEdit) by pressing F5 in the code editor.

stdout/stderr are logged into the JS console, for better or worse.

A single preference sets up the snippet-tester.exe path.
